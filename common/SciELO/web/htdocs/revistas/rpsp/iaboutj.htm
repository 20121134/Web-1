    combat disease; to prolong life; and to stimulate people's physical, mental, and social
    development.<p>The journal publishes information of interest in the field of public
    health, especially as it relates to PAHO's technical cooperation programs, as well as news
    about the principles, actions, and achievements of the Organization and its Member

    the hemisphere.</p>

    Panamericana</strong> and the <strong>Bulletin of the Pan American Health Organization</strong>,
    and publishes original, peer-reviewed research articles in English, Spanish, and
    Portuguese with each article in Spanish and Portuguese containing an English abstract.</p>
    <p>The monthly pressrun for the journal is around 12,000 copies. It is distributed to
    public health professionals, technical personnel, researchers, and students involved in
    all aspects of the field in the Americas and elsewhere in the world. It is also available
    in major biomedical libraries.</p>
