    <td width="70%">The purpose of the <strong>Brazilian Journal of Medical and Biological
    Research</strong> is to publish the results of original research which contribute
    significantly to knowledge in medical and biological sciences. Preference will be given to
    manuscripts that develop new concepts or experimental approaches and are not merely
    repositories of scientific data. Methodological papers shall be considered for publication
    provided they describe new principles or a significant improvement of existing methods.
    Papers that report preliminary results or are only confirmatory in nature will not be
    accepted for publication.<p>Submission of manuscripts implies that the same work has not
    been published and is not under consideration for publication elsewhere. When part of the
    material has been presented in a preliminary communication or in an unrefereed symposium,
    this should be cited as a footnote on the title page and a copy should accompany the
    submitted manuscript. When appropriate, papers in the area of Clinical Investigation
    should include a statement indicating that the protocol has been approved by the Hospital
    Ethics Committee (Hospital with which at least one of the authors is associated).</p>
    <p>The Journal publishes <strong>Full-length Papers</strong>, <strong>Short Communications</strong>,
    <strong>Review Articles</strong>, and sections containing <strong>Concepts and Comments</strong>
    and <strong>Reports of Scientific Meetings</strong>. The decision of acceptance for
    publication lies with the <a href="iedboard.htm#Ed1">Editors</a> and is based on the
    recommendations of the <a href="iedboard.htm#Ed3">Editorial Board</a> and/or <em>ad hoc</em>

    <p>Manuscripts should be submitted in English in <strong>quadruplicate</strong>. Authors
    are requested to use American rather than British spelling, except, of course, for
    references whose titles should appear exactly as published. Manuscripts should be either
    typed or computer printed <strong>double-spaced</strong> with wide margins of at least
    1&quot; on good quality paper and all copies should be sharp and fully legible.</p>
    <p>A manuscript submitted for publication should be accompanied by a cover letter

    including zip code, telephone number, fax number and e-mail of corresponding author, main
    subject area of the paper, a statement indicating if the paper is intended to be a full
    paper or short communication, and, if the authors so wish, the names of five persons who
    could act as referees.</p>
    <p>Papers should be written so that they are intelligible to the non-specialist reader of
    the Journal. Where the reader is referred to previous papers by the same authors for
    important details relevant to the present work, it will facilitate review if reprints are
    enclosed with the manuscript.</p>
    <p>The dates of receipt and acceptance will be published. If the paper is returned to the
    authors for revision and not returned within 2 months, the date of receipt will be
    revised. The date of acceptance will be assigned when the authors return the manuscript
    after the final correction for English style and clarity. The length of the manuscript and
    the number of tables and figures should be kept to a minimum.</p>
    <p>Proofs will be sent to authors for the correction of printer's errors. Other changes
    may require another editorial review and the additional expenses for correction will be
    charged to the authors. Fifty (50) reprints of each paper will be supplied free of charge.</td>

    <td width="70%">The manuscript should be assembled in the following order with all pages
    numbered consecutively starting from the title page.<p><b>Title page</b><br>
    a) title<br>
    b) initials and last name(s) of author(s) (matched with superscript numbers identifying
    institutions)<br>
    c) name and address of institution(s) where work was done<br>
    d) acknowledgment of research grants and fellowships (agency and grant number)<br>
    e) name, complete mailing address, including zip code, telephone number, fax number and
    e-mail of author to whom correspondence and requests for reprints should be sent.</p>
    <p><b>Running title</b><br>
    This short title to be used as a page heading should not exceed 60 letters and spaces.</p>
    <p><b>Key words</b><br>
    A list of key words or indexing terms (no more than 6) should be included. The Journal
    recommends the use of medical subject headings of Index Medicus for key words to avoid the
    use of several synonyms as entry terms in the index for different papers on the same
    subject.</p>
    <p><b>Abstract</b><br>
    A concise statement not to exceed 250 words in a single paragraph <strong>double-spaced</strong>
    should be written on a separate page following the title page. The abstract should briefly
    and clearly present the problem, experimental approach, new results as quantitative data,
    and conclusions. Footnotes and undefined abbreviations may not be used. If a reference
    must be used, the full citation should be given within the abstract. Since abstracts are
    published separately by Information Services, they should contain sufficient hard data to
    be appreciated by the reader, who may not have access to the full paper.</p>
    <p><b>Footnotes</b><br>
    Text footnotes, if unavoidable, should be numbered consecutively in superscript in the
    manuscript and written on a separate page following the abstract.</p>
    <p><b>Introduction</b><br>
    This should state the purpose of the investigation, relationship to other work in the
    field, and reasons for undertaking the research. An extensive listing or review of the
    literature is not recommended.</p>
    <p><b>Material and Methods</b><br>
    Sufficient information should be provided in the text or by referring to papers in
    generally available journals to permit the work to be repeated.</p>
    <p><b>Results</b><br>
    The results should be presented clearly and concisely. Tables and figures should be used
    only when necessary for effective comprehension of the data. In some situations it may be
    desirable to combine Results and Discussion in a single section.</p>
    <p><b>Discussion</b><br>
    The purpose of the Discussion is to interpret the results and relate them to existing
    knowledge. Information given elsewhere in the text may be cited but not repeated in detail
    in the Discussion.</p>
    <p><b>Acknowledgments</b><br>
    If appropriate, briefly acknowledge technical assistance, advice and assistance from
    colleagues, etc. Financial support for the research and fellowships should be acknowledged
    on the title page.</p>
    <p><b>References</b><br>
    References should be cited in the text by number in parentheses in order of citation and
    typed <strong>double-spaced</strong> in numerical order on a separate sheet.</p>
    <p>The following information must be given: last name and initials of all authors, year of
    publication, title of article, complete name of Journal (no abbreviations), volume and
    pages. If reference is a book, also give names and initials of editors, publisher and
    city. Examples:</p>

    structure and partial analysis of the kallikrein gene locus. <em>Journal of Biological
    Chemistry</em>, 262: 8027-8034.</p>
    <p>Note that references are <strong>not</strong> in alphabetical order and should include
    the title of the article.</p>
    <p>Papers accepted for publication may be cited in the Reference section. The citation
    should be complete and should end with: (in press).</p>
    <p>Reference to &quot;unpublished results&quot; and &quot;submitted papers&quot; should
    appear in the text in parentheses following the individual name(s). Example: (Santos CS,
    da-Silva GB and Martins LT, <strong>unpublished results</strong>). It is assumed that the
    author has obtained permission from the source when &quot;personal communication&quot; is
    used.</p>
    <p><b>Tables</b><br>
    Tables should be numbered consecutively with Arabic numerals and grouped together after
    the References section. All tables must be cited in the text in numerical order and the
    approximate position of each indicated in the margin. Each table should be typed <strong>double-spaced
    </strong>on a separate page (or, if exceptionally large or requiring special symbols or
    unusual treatment, the table should be submitted camera-ready). A descriptive title and
    legend, in the form as they appear in the Journal, should make tables understandable
    without reference to the text (see a recent issue of the Journal). Vertical and diagonal
    rules should not be used in tables; instead, indentation and vertical or horizontal space
    should be used to group data.</p>
    <p><b>Figure legends</b><br>
    Type all figure legends <strong>double-spaced</strong> consecutively on a separate page.
    Explain all symbols and abbreviations. Legends should make figures understandable without
    reference to the text. All figures must be cited in the text in numerical order and the
    approximate position of each indicated in the margin.</p>
    <p><b>Figures</b><br>
    Submit one set of original artwork and three copies of line drawings suitable for reviewer
    evaluation. Four black and white photographs of photomicrographs should be submitted and a
    magnification bar should be added to each figure with its length reported in the legend.</p>
    <p>All figures must be camera-ready and have a professional appearance. Poor-quality
    figures or illegible labeling may result in delayed acceptance and publication. Figures
    will not be returned to authors even when paper is not accepted.</p>
    <p>&quot;Glossies&quot; are appropriate only when hand-drawn artwork must be retained by
    the author. They should not be submitted in the case of computer-generated artwork. Please
    send <strong>original laser prints on high-quality paper </strong>instead. Use lettering
    of sufficient size to be legible after reduction, when appropriate. Use uppercase letters
    A,B,C, etc. to identify individual parts of multi-part figures. Symbols for the
    identification of curves in a graph can be added to the body of a figure when this does
    not cause &quot;crowding&quot;, or at the bottom of the figure.</p>
    <p>Check figures carefully before submission to be sure that proper versions are being
    sent and that there are no labeling errors. Each figure must be clearly identified. Using
    a soft pencil, write on the back of each figure the name of the first author and the
    number of the figure and identify the top with an arrow. Figures should be numbered
    separately using consecutive Arabic numerals in the order they appear in the text.</p>
    <p><b>Units</b><br>
    The Système International (SI) of metric units is used for units and abbreviations of
    units. Examples: s for second, min for minute, h for hour, l for liter, m for meter, kDa
    for kilodaltons, 5 mM rather than 5 x 10-3, M or 0.005 M, etc.</p>
    <p><b>Abbreviations</b><br>
    Abbreviations should be avoided or kept to a minimum. If used, they must be defined at the
    first mention. Abbreviations should not appear in the title nor, if possible, in the
    abstract.</td>
