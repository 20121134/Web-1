    href="http://www.paho.org">PAHO</a>), and continues the <strong>Boletín de la Oficina
    Sanitaria Panamericana</strong> and the <strong>Bulletin of the Pan American Health

    for disseminating research findings from the countries of the Region in areas that relate
    to the Organization's purposes: to promote action and coordinate efforts directed toward
    health promotion in the countries of the Americas; to combat disease; to prolong life; and
    to stimulate people's physical, mental, and social development. </p>
    <p align="left">The journal publishes information of interest in the field of public
    health,especially as it relates to PAHO's technical cooperation programs, as well as news
    about the principles, actions, and achievements of the Organization and its Member
    Governments in improving health conditions and strengthening the health sector throughout

    <td width="70%">The Pan American Health Organization holds the copyright to material
    published in the journal. Manuscripts are accepted with the understanding that they have
    not been published elsewhere, in part or in whole, and that they will not be published in
    the future without the express authorization of PAHO. Articles are considered
    simultaneously for publication in English and Spanish or Portuguese (see also Section II.C
    - <a href="#C. Language">Language</a>).<p>The selection of material for publication is
    based on the following criteria: importance of the subject matter for the Organization and
    the Member Governments; scientific soundness, originality, currency, and timeliness of the
    information; significance at the regional level of the experience described; compliance
    with the standards of medical ethics governing experimentation with human and animal
    subjects; respect for the Member Governments and the people they represent; and
    achievement of a balanced mix in terms of both topics and geographic origin of the
    information. Acceptance or rejection of a manuscript is based on an objective selection
    process (described in<br>
    Section II.O - <a href="#O. Selection Process">Selection Process</a>).</p>
    <p>It is especially important that the objective of the study be accurately described,
    that the study itself be well-designed, that the results be clearly stated, and that the
    significance of the study be thoroughly discussed. Shortcomings in these areas are
    frequently the cause for rejection of a manuscript.</p>
    <p>Papers presented at meetings or conferences rarely qualify as scientific articles
    because they usually do not meet the criteria required of a scientific paper in terms of
    objectives and structure. Articles that report preliminary, as opposed to definitive,
    results are usually not accepted. Also, as a rule, articles that form part of a series
    dealing with different aspects of a single research project are not accepted.</p>
    <p>The authors alone are responsible for the views expressed, which may not necessarily
    reflect the opinion or policy of PAHO or its Member Governments. The mention of specific
    companies or of certain manufacturers' products does not imply that they are endorsed or
    recommended by PAHO in preference to others of a similar nature that are not mentioned.</td>

    <td width="70%">The major part of the journal is devoted to original articles on public
    health and related disciplines, in particular those involved with meeting the goal of
    &quot;Health for All by the Year 2000.&quot; Information is also published on the
    principles, decisions, and achievements of the Organization.<p>Among the specific subject
    areas addressed are maternal and child health, communicable diseases, chronic diseases,
    health promotion and protection, food and nutrition, accident prevention, mental health,
    workers' health, health of the elderly, health of the disabled, dental health,
    environmental health, disaster preparedness, veterinary public health, epidemiology,
    health statistics, information sciences, research and technology, scientific and technical
    information, health sector administration, legislation, policy, strategic planning, health
    services and systems, human resources, financing and costs, community participation,
    health education, and intersectoral coordination.</p>
    <p>The journal contents is organized as follows:</p>
    <p>1. <strong>From the Director</strong>. This editorial presents information on the
    political principles that guide the Organization and the current public health trends and
    priorities in the Region of the Americas.</p>
    <p>2. <strong>Articles</strong>. These may be reports of original research, critical
    reviews, reviews of the literature, or reports of experiences applicable throughout the
    Region.</p>
    <p>3. <strong>Current Topics</strong>. This section includes technical reports of less
    than full-article length; updates on projects and programs; reports of meetings, symposia,
    and conferences in which the Organization and the Member Governments have participated;
    and other appropriate communications about ongoing work in the area of health.</p>
    <p>4. <strong>Instantáneas</strong> (in Spanish only). Summaries of articles recently
    published in other major journals, or of newspaper articles and press releases, are
    provided in this section. The materials are selected on the basis of their relevance
    within the context of public health in the Region.</p>
    <p>5. <strong>Publications</strong>. This section offers brief summaries of current
    publications and occasional reviews of recent books dealing with various aspects of public
    health and related disciplines. Readers are invited to submit reviews of books on subjects
    within their area of expertise, with the understanding that the publication of such
    reviews will be at the discretion of the editorial staff and will depend on compliance
    with book review guidelines. These will be mailed to anyone who requests them.</p>
    <p>6. <strong>Letters</strong>. Letters to the editor which clarify, discuss, or comment
    in a constructive manner on ideas expressed in the journal are welcomed. Letters should be
    signed by the author and specify his or her professional affiliation and address.</td>

    <td width="70%"><strong>A. Specifications</strong><p>In general, the journal follows the
    &quot;Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals,&quot; (5th
    ed., 1993) developed by the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (see <a
    href="#Bibliography">Bibliography</a>). These guidelines are also known as the
    &quot;Vancouver style&quot; and are described in detail under Section II.J - <a
    href="#J. Bibliographic References">Bibliographic References</a>.</p>
    <p>The following paragraphs give practical instructions and illustrative examples for the
    preparation of a manuscript. Authors who do not follow this format in the presentation of
    their papers run the risk of having their articles rejected without further review.</p>
    <p><strong>B. Submitting the Manuscript</strong></p>
    <p>The original manuscript, three photocopies, and a computer diskette containing the text
    (see Section II.E - <a href="#E. Typographic Specifications">Typographic Specifications</a>)
    should be sent to: Chief, <a href="#PAHO Publications Program">Publications Program</a>
    (DBI). Receipt of the manuscript will be acknowledged in writing.</p>
    <p><a name="C. Language"><strong>C. Language</strong></a></p>
    <p>The journal publishes articles in English, Spanish, and Portuguese, but manuscripts are
    accepted in any of the official languages of PAHO (English, French, Portuguese, and
    Spanish). Authors are strongly urged to write in their native language, since insufficient
    command of a foreign language may obscure the meaning of the text, especially when dealing
    with highly technical subject matter.</p>
    <p>Articles selected for the journal will not necessarily appear in the language of the
    original manuscript; instead, the decision on the language in which to publish will be
    based on the segment of readers for which it holds greatest scientific interest and
    practical application.</p>
    <p><strong>D. Copyright</strong></p>
    <p>Every article must be accompanied by a statement to the effect that the article has not
    been published before and that it will not be submitted to any other journal before a
    decision has been reached by PAHO. Authors must attach a signed statement indicating that
    if the manuscript is accepted for publication in the journal, the copyright will be held
    by PAHO.</p>
    <p>Authors are requested to give full information about any fellowship or grant accepted
    from WHO, PAHO, or any other organization that was used to defray the cost of research on
    which the article was based.</p>
    <p>Authors are responsible for obtaining permission to reproduce any copyrighted material.
    The manuscript must be accompanied by the original letter granting such permission. This
    letter should specify the exact table, figure, or text being cited and how it is being
    used, together with a complete bibliographic reference to the original source (see<br>
    Section II.J - <a href="#J. Bibliographic References">Bibliographic References</a>).</p>
    <p>Only those who participated directly in the research or the drafting of the article,
    and are therefore in a position to assume responsibility for its content, may be listed as
    authors. Inclusion of other persons as authors, out of friendship or other nonscientific
    motivation, is a breach of ethics.</p>
    <p><a name="E. Typographic Specifications"><strong>E. Typographic Specifications</strong></a></p>
    <p>The entire manuscript must not exceed 15 letter-size (8.5 3 11&quot;) or ISO A4 (212 mm
    3 297 mm) pages. It should be typed or printed in black, on only one side of each page,
    with double or triple spacing and with top and bottom margins of about 4 cm. The left and
    right margins should be at least 3 cm wide. Words should not be broken at the end of a
    line with a facultative hyphen. The pages should be numbered consecutively, and three
    clear photocopies of the original should be included. Carbon copies are not acceptable.</p>
    <p>It is preferred that manuscripts be prepared on computer or word-processing equipment
    and that a version on computer diskette (3.5 or 5.25 inch) be supplied along with the
    printout. Any IBM-compatible or Macintosh word-processing software is acceptable, but
    Microsoft Word is preferred.</p>
    <p>Manuscripts not complying with the specifications outlined above will not be accepted.
    In the case of papers translated in their entirety or containing translations of quoted
    material, a copy of the original text must be attached.</p>
    <p>Articles which are accepted will undergo an editorial process that may involve
    condensation of the text and deletion or addition of tables, figures, or annexes. The
    edited version will be sent to the corresponding author for clearance.</p>
    <p><strong>F. Title and Authors</strong></p>
    <p>The title should be limited to 10 words, if possible, and should not exceed 15. It
    should describe the article's content specifically, clearly, and concisely. Ambiguous
    words, jargon, and abbreviations should be avoided. A good title makes it easy to grasp
    what the article is about and should help documentation centers accurately catalogue and
    classify the material.</p>
    <p>The full names of all authors, the names of their institutions, and their mailing
    addresses should be given immediately under the title. The RPSP/PAJPH does not list
    authors' academic degrees or honorary titles.</p>
    <p>The mailing address of the principal author or the person who will be responsible for
    answering correspondence concerning the article must be included. If a post office box is
    given, an additional street address must be provided to which material may be delivered by
    commercial courier.</p>
    <p><strong>G. Abstract</strong></p>
    <p>Every submission must include an abstract. This should be about 150 words long if it is
    descriptive or 250 words if it is structured, and should clearly indicate (a) the
    objectives of the study; (b) the date and place where it was carried out; (c) the basic
    procedures&#151;methods of sampling, observation, and analysis; (d) the principal
    results-specific data and, if appropriate, their statistical significance; and (e) the
    main conclusions. Emphasis should be on the article's new and scientifically relevant
    aspects.</p>
    <p>The abstract should not include any information or conclusions that do not appear in
    the text. It should be written in the third person and should not contain abbreviations,
    references to the main text, or bibliographic citations.</p>
    <p>The abstract must enable readers to determine the relevance of the content and decide
    whether or not they are interested in reading the entire text. In fact, the abstract is
    the part of the article which will be most widely read. The abstract along with the title
    will appear in bibliographic information systems such as Index Medicus.</p>
    <p><strong>H. Body of the Article</strong></p>
    <p>Articles that report on research or studies are usually organized according to the
    &quot;IMRAD&quot; format: Introduction, Materials and Methods, Results, and Discussion.
    Reviews of the literature or updates may require other types of headings depending on
    their content.</p>
    <p><strong>I. Footnotes</strong></p>
    <p>These clarifications (e.g., definitions, supplementary but nonessential information)
    appear at the bottom of the page on which they are cited. A footnote should be separated
    from the text by a horizontal rule and identified by a superscript numeral. The numbering
    of footnotes should be consecutive throughout the paper.</p>
    <p><a name="J. Bibliographic References"><strong>J. Bibliographic References</strong></a></p>
    <p>Citations must be used to identify the original sources of concepts, methods, and
    techniques derived from previous research, studies, and experiences; to support facts and
    opinions expressed by the author; and to provide guidance for the reader interested in
    knowing more about particular points mentioned in the paper.</p>
    <p>Except in the case of a review of the literature, manuscripts to be considered for the
    journal should include 10 to 20 bibliographic references that are both relevant and
    current. Review articles will generally cite more sources.</p>
    <p>Citations should be indicated in the text by consecutive, italicized or underlined
    numbers in parentheses. For example:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>&quot;It has been observed (<em>3, 4</em>) that . . .&quot;</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>&quot;Several authors (<em>1-5</em>) have said that . . .&quot;</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The list of references must be numbered consecutively in the order in which the
    citations appear in the text. Only cited works are to be included in that list. Works that
    were consulted but not cited in the text should be listed separately under the heading
    &quot;Bibliography&quot; and arranged alphabetically by author.</p>
    <p>The list of references or bibliography should begin on a separate sheet at the end of
    the article, and the format must follow the instructions given below.</p>
    <p><strong>1. Journal Articles</strong>. The following information must be provided:
    author(s), article title, journal title (underlined or in italics), year of publication,
    volume number (in Arabic numerals), and inclusive page numbers. All this information
    should be given in the original language of the work cited. The examples below illustrate
    the &quot;Vancouver style&quot; of reference construction and punctuation, which should be
    followed.</p>
    <p><strong>a. Individual authors</strong>. When there are six or fewer authors, the
    surnames and initials of all the authors should be included; when there are more than six
    authors, only the first six should be listed, followed by &quot;et al.&quot; For example:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Brownie C, Habicht JP, Cogill B. Comparing indicators of health and nutritional status.
      <em>Am J Epidemiol</em> 1986;124:1031-1044.</p>

      the geographic variation of invasive cervical cancer in Costa Rica. <em>Bull Pan Am Health
      Organ</em> 1993; 27:15-25. </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><strong>b. Article published in several parts</strong>.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Fitzharding PM, Stevens EM. The small-for-date infant: II, neurological and
      intellectual sequelae. <em>Pediatrics</em> 1972; 50:50-57.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><strong>c. Corporate author</strong>. In the case of unsigned articles in journals
    published by governmental or international organizations, the organization is regarded as
    the author. If several elements compose the corporate author, they should be given in
    descending order, from largest to smallest. For example:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Pan American Health Organization, Expanded Program on Immunization. Strategies for the
      certification of the eradication of wild poliovirus transmission in the Americas. <em>Bull
      Pan Am Health Organ</em> 1993; 27:287-295.</p>

    </blockquote>
    <p><strong>e. Special types of articles</strong>. Indicate type or format of the work in
    square brackets. For example:</p>
    <blockquote>

      1990; 68 (suppl):138-144.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><strong>2. Papers Presented at Conferences</strong>. Only those conference papers that
    have been published in official proceedings or other formal publications should be
    included in the list of references</p>
    <blockquote>

    written reports that readers can obtain. It is important to indicate the exact name of the
    collective entity responsible for the document, the full title, place and year of
    publication, and document number. If possible, the source of the document should be
    provided. For example:</p>

      Collections, Chicago, Illinois.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>If it is not possible to obtain copies of the source in question, the source should not
    be cited as a footnote; instead, a brief reference to it should be made in the body of the
    text:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>It has been demonstrated (Little DA, Ecology Center of New York, unpublished
      observations, 1990) that . . .</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><strong>5. Personal Communications</strong>. Reference to a personal communication

    <p><strong>K. Tables</strong></p>
    <p>Tables are the ordered presentation of information (usually numeric) by the systematic
    arrangement of values in rows and columns. Tables should be used to present essential
    information involving repetitive variables, characteristics, or attributes so that
    frequency, relationships, contrasts, variations, or trends may be easily understood by the
    reader. They should be self-explanatory and supplement, not duplicate, the information in
    the text.</p>
    <p>Tables should not contain so much statistical information that they confuse the readers
    or cause them to lose interest. Each table should be presented on a separate sheet of
    paper and be identified by a number. Each should have a clear, brief title. The place,
    date, and source of the information should be clearly indicated.</p>
    <p>The column heads should be as brief as possible and indicate the unit of measure or the
    relative base (percentage, rate, index), if any. Cells should only be left blank if the
    data do not apply. If information is missing because no observations were made, this
    should be indicated by ellipses points (. . .).</p>
    <p>Vertical rules (lines) should not be used in tables, but three horizontal rules should
    be used: one under the title line, a second under the column heads, and a third at the end
    of the table, above the footnotes.</p>
    <p>Footnotes to a table should be called using superscripted lowercase letters in
    alphabetical order.</p>
    <p><strong>L. Figures</strong></p>
    <p>Graphs, diagrams, line drawings, maps, and photographs should be used to call attention
    to trends and illustrate comparisons clearly and exactly. Figures should be easy to
    understand and should add information, not duplicate it. Drawings should be done in India
    ink or generated in black and white from a high-quality computer printer. Drawings and
    legends should be camera-ready and placed between sheets of cardboard to protect them in
    transit.</p>
    <p>All figures should be fully identified on their reverse sides. The captions should be
    as brief as possible but at the same time explicit. Figures should not have footnotes, but
    if taken from other publications their sources must be identified. The captions of the
    figures should be typed or printed on a separate sheet of paper in numerical order. The
    legend of a graph or map should be included as part of the figure itself. Maps and
    diagrams must be drawn to scale and must indicate what scale has been used.</p>
    <p>Photographs should be black and white on glossy paper with high resolution and
    contrast. The captions should include background information, scale, source, and date. All
    photographs should be numbered on the back and given a clear, brief title. This
    information should be written on a label and stuck to the back of the photo. (Care must be
    taken not to create an imprint on the photo with a ball-point pen.)</p>
    <p>An excess of graphic materials diminishes the desired effect; therefore, it is
    important that photos be carefully selected with the objective of complementing the text.</p>
    <p><strong>M. Abbreviations</strong></p>
    <p>Insofar as possible, abbreviations should be avoided. They should be given in
    parentheses preceded by their expanded form the first time the concept is mentioned in the
    text. For example:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI)</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Abbreviations should reflect the expanded form in the language in which the manuscript
    is written. However, this rule does not apply to abbreviations of national agencies, those
    that are internationally known in another language (CELADE, ILPES, ISO), or
    internationally recognized abbreviations (SI for Système international). (See also<br>
    Section II.N. - <a href="#N. Units of Measure">Units of Measure</a>)</p>
    <p><a name="N. Units of Measure"><strong>N. Units of Measure</strong></a></p>
    <p>Authors must use the International System of Units (SI) and the metric units approved
    for use in conjunction with the SI (see <a href="#Bibliography">Bibliography</a>). British
    units of measure are not acceptable.</p>
    <p>It should be noted that in this system the abbreviations of units are not pluralized
    (for example, 5 km, not 5 kms), and they are not followed by a period (10 mL, not 10 mL.)
    unless they are at the end of a sentence.</p>
    <p>Numbers should be grouped in sets of three to the left and to the right of the decimal
    point, with each set separated by a blank space. They should not be separated by any form
    of punctuation.</p>
    <p><em>Correct style</em>:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>12 500 350 (twelve million five hundred thousand three hundred fifty)</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>1 900.05 (one thousand nine hundred and five hundredths)</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><em>Incorrect styles</em>:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>12,500,350 / 1.900,05 / 1,900.05</p>

    <p><a name="O. Selection Process"><strong>O. Selection Process</strong></a></p>
    <p>The manuscripts received are peer reviewed by experts on the subject in question. The
    first review is done by the Chief Editor and determines whether or not the manuscript
    meets the general criteria outlined. The second review considers the scientific merit of
    the document and the usefulness of its publication; it is performed by a panel of subject
    experts who review the manuscript independently.</p>
    <p>In the third review, based on the results of the evaluation of general criteria,
    scientific merit, and usefulness of its publication, a decision is made to either: (a)
    reject the manuscript and return it to the author; (b) accept it with the condition that
    revisions be made according to the comments and recommendations of the reviewers; or (c)
    accept it without requiring that the author(s) make major changes.</p>
    <p>In the case of a conditional acceptance, the revised text undergoes a fourth review to
    make certain that the author has responded to the reviewers' concerns. If the problems
    have been dealt with and resolved, the article is then accepted; if not, it is rejected.</p>
    <p>All decisions are communicated in writing to the principal author as promptly as
    possible. The time required to process a manuscript varies depending on the complexity of
    the subject and the availability of expert reviewers.</p>
    <p><strong>P. Publication of the Accepted Article</strong></p>
    <p>Manuscripts are accepted with the understanding that the publisher reserves the right
    to make revisions necessary for consistency, clarity, and conformity with the style of the
    journal.</p>
    <p>Manuscripts accepted for publication will be edited and then sent to the principal
    author for responses to queries and approval of any changes made. Authors will not receive
    galleys; therefore they should read the edited manuscript carefully. To avoid delay,
    authors are urged to return the edited manuscript, with their approval, by the date
    indicated in the accompanying letter. Normally, there is a period of three months between
    the time that the cleared article is returned to PAHO and the time of publication.</p>
    <p><strong>Q. Author's Copies</strong></p>
    <p>As soon as the article is published, 10 copies of the issue in which it appears will be
    sent to the principal author.</td>
