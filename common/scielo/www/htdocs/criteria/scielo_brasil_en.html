    <b><p><font face="Verdana" size="2">1 Introduction</font></p>
    </b><p><font face="Verdana" size="2">This document describes the evaluation criteria
    adopted by the SciELO Project (<a HREF="http://www.scielo.org/">http://www.scielo.org</a>)
    for admission and permanence of scientific journals in the SciELO Brazil (<a
    HREF="http://www.scielo.br/">http://www.scielo.br</a>) electronic collection.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">These criteria, as well as the policy and procedures for
    governing their application, were discussed in the Seminar on the Evaluation and Selection
    Criteria for Scientific Journals, held in April 1999 at FAPESP, São Paulo, and later
    approved by FAPESP (<a href="http://www.fapesp.br">http://www.fapesp.br</a>) and BIREME (<a
    href="http://www.bireme.br">http://www.bireme.br</a>). They are referred hereinafter as
    SciELO Brazil Criteria since they have a close relationship to the Brazilian scientific
    publication both concerning their definition and application. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">As the SciELO Project expands through Latin American
    countries, it is expected that such criteria will be progressively improved and
    generalized emerging to establish common criteria for admission and permanence of
    scientific journals in national and / or regional SciELO collections.</font> <ol>

    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">2 SciELO Brazil Criteria Objectives</font></p>
    </b><p><font face="Verdana" size="2">SciELO Brazil Criteria are defined in the context of
    the SciELO Project, which is coordinated by FAPESP and BIREME. The general goal of the
    SciELO Project is to contribute to the development of the national scientific research by
    improving and expanding its means of dissemination, publication, and evaluation through
    the intensive use of electronic publishing.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In the short term, the SciELO Project intends to
    radically increase the national and international visibility, accessibility and
    credibility of the Latin American and Caribbean scientific publication, through the
    integrated publishing of national and regional collections of scientific journals on the
    Internet. In the long term, the project envisions to increase the impact of the national
    scientific literature.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In order to accomplish the SciELO Project objectives, it
    is essential the improvement of every aspect of the scientific communication in the
    country, seeking to identify, stimulate, and develop a core collection of scientific
    journals, in which the quality standards match international leading scientific journal
    standards. Therefore, the evaluation criteria for journals, as well as the policies and
    procedures for their application are a fundamental line of action for the SciELO Project.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Aiming at contributing to the creation and development of
    the SciELO Brazil core collection of scientific journals, the specific goals of the SciELO
    Brazil Criteria include:</font> <ol TYPE="a" style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 10pt">
      <li><font face="Verdana" size="2">providing data for the evaluation of national scientific
        journals in order to determine their admission to the SciELO Brazil collection;</font></li>
      <li><font face="Verdana" size="2">monitoring the performance of the scientific journals
        included in the SciELO Brazil collection in order to determine their permanence in this
        collection;</font></li>
      <li><font face="Verdana" size="2">producing performance indicators for the SciELO Brazil
        collection as a whole, and for each of its individual journals.</font></li>
    </ol>
    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The SciELO Brazil Criteria contents and application will
    follow the SciELO Project dynamics and, specially, the process of creating and developing
    the SciELO Brazil core collection.</font></p>

    submitted contributions.</font></p>

    should start from 1997, or from its first issue in the case of journals founded after that
